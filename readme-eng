By using the script you accept the licence agreement (Licence.txt).

You must have AHK (AutoHotkey) installed for the application to work properly.

The script does not contain viruses (may be defined as a malware, because it is an input script, but it is not dangerous. If you have any questions, please contact moderators).

The script is not detected and is not banned by the game antichit. However, the team of moderators is not responsible for the received blocking as a result of the action of the patrol (intervention of the administration) on the servers in Rust. In other words, the use of any scripts can be punished by the administration of servers. Some servers may block for this script, some may not (maximum individually). 

AHK scripts are not blocked by RUST. Despite the fact that more than 6 years ago there was a wave of blocking for them, now the use of scripts is safe.
